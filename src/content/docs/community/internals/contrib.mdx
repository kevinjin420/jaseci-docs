## General Setup and Information

To get setup run

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.jacenv/
source ~/.jacenv/bin/activate
pip3 install pre-commit pytest pytest-xdist
pre-commit install
```

Pre-commit handles all linting (ruff), formatting, and type checking (mypy) automatically when you commit.

This is how we run our tests.

```bash
pytest -n auto jac
pytest jac-scale
pytest jac-byllm
jac test jac/examples/littleX/littleX.test.jac

```

## Run docs site locally

```bash
pip install -e docs
python docs/scripts/mkdocs_serve.py

```

## Release Flow (Automated)

Releasing new versions to PyPI is a two-step process using GitHub Actions.

### Step 1: Create and Merge the Release PR

1. Go to **GitHub Actions** → **Create Release PR**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. For each package, select the version bump type (`skip`, `patch`, `minor`, or `major`)
4. Click **Run workflow**

**What happens automatically:**

- The workflow runs `scripts/release.py` to bump versions in the relevant `pyproject.toml` files
- Creates a new branch with the version changes
- Opens a PR with a summary of all version bumps (example: [PR #4675](https://github.com/jaseci-labs/jaseci/pull/4675))

1. **Review the PR** - Verify the version bumps are correct
2. Wait for CI tests to pass, then **approve and merge** the PR to main

### Step 2: Publish to PyPI

After the release PR is merged, manually trigger the release workflow for each bumped package.

:::caution[Release Order]
Packages must be released in dependency order. **jaclang must be released first** since other packages depend on it.
:::


| Order | Package | Workflow | Dependencies |
|-------|---------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | **jaclang** | Release jaclang to PYPI | None (core package) |
| 2 | **jac-client** | Release jac-client to PYPI | jaclang |
| 3 | **jac-byllm** | Release jac-byllm to PYPI | jaclang |
| 4 | **jac-scale** | Release jac-scale to PYPI | jaclang |
| 5 | **jac-super** | Release jac-super to PYPI | jaclang |
| 6 | **jaseci** | Release jaseci to PYPI | Meta-package (release last) |

#### How to Trigger a Release

For each package you need to release:

1. Go to **GitHub Actions** → Select the appropriate release workflow
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Click **Run workflow** again to confirm

**What happens automatically:**

- Precompiles bytecode for Python 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14
- Builds the package distribution
- Publishes to PyPI

:::tip[Best Practice]
Wait for each workflow to complete successfully before starting the next one. Check the Actions tab to monitor progress.
