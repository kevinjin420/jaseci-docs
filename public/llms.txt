# Jac Programming Language

> Jac is an AI-native programming language that supersets Python and JavaScript. It adds first-class LLM integration, object-spatial programming (graphs, walkers, nodes, edges), and scale-native deployment constructs. Full access to PyPI and npm ecosystems.

## Quick Start

Install: `pip install jaseci`
Run: `jac hello.jac`
Deploy: `jac start --scale`

## Key Features

- **by llm()**: Replace function bodies with LLM calls. No prompt engineering required.
- **Object-Spatial Programming**: Model domains as graphs with nodes, edges, and walkers.
- **Full-Stack**: React-style frontend (jac-client) + Python backend in one language.
- **Scale-Native**: `jac start --scale` deploys to Kubernetes with Redis, MongoDB automatically.
- **Python Superset**: All Python code is valid Jac code. Import any PyPI package.

## Core Syntax

```jac
# Nodes and edges define graph structure
node Person { has name: str; }
edge Knows { has since: int; }

# Walkers traverse graphs
walker Greeter {
    can greet with Person entry {
        print(f"Hello, {here.name}!");
    }
}

# AI integration with by llm()
can classify(text: str) -> str
by llm(incl_info=(text));
```
